Patrick Collison, as of the time of this writing, describes himself in his Twtitter bio as "Fallibilist, Optimist, Stripe CEO".

In my corner of twitter, and from what I can tell, in technology circiles generally, Stripe has an almost mythical reputation.
My favorite example of this is a recruiting message from Jeff that suggested candidates should be "oddly effective at most things."

I want to connect what I think is a deep relationship between Patrick's bio and the kind of culture that makes companies, and technology companies in particular, oddly effective at most things.

The monikers "fallibilist, optimist" are a reference to the philosophy of David Deutsch, as most thoroughly explained in his book [The Beginning of Infinity](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0143121359).  They describe two fundamental features of the relationship between people and knowledge, which David summarizes with the slogans "Problems are inevitable, and problems are soluble."

The inevitability of problems is the "fallibilist" side of Collison's self-description.  Our knowledge is finite and imperfect.  We try to improve it through tools like reason, rationality, science, conjecture, and criticism.  This describes something like a fundamental limitation for humans, and people more generally.  It describes a counterintuitively strong prohibition on claims to perfect knowledge, or even an approach to having "most" knowledge.  Instead, we are always at "the beginning of infinity".

The opposite, and more redemptive, side of this equation, is a special use of the word "optimist".  It doesn't describe an attitude or an emotion, but a specific idea, that problems are soluble.  In particular, we can create knowledge to solve problems.  This includes all of the methods described above to generate new knowledge: science, reason, and the rest.  The scope of this power is similarly surprising compared to what we might intuitively expect.  For more detailed explanations, see the book.  But the gist of it is that because knowledge can keep growing indefinitely, the only limits on what are acheivable with knowledge are those imposed by the most fundamental laws of physics.  Beyond that, just about anything that can be conceived can be acheived... with the right knowledge.


Where this comes into connection with business is something like the real underlying secret behind self-help gtifts like The Secret.
It is the same kind of underlying phenomena described by Taoists when they talk about being In Accord With The Tao.  And it is the reason that persistence is not merely somewhat better than half-heartedness, but exponentially better.

The disposition to solve problems is almost a pre-requisite for their solution, and the amount of energy and creativity that someone can and will apply to the solution of the problem scales with their belief both explicit and inexplicit that that effort is likely to bear fruit.
Patrick has the advantage, then, that when Stripe recruits people who share deeply the disposition to pursue with energy and directness the solution to any given problem, there is a compounding effect, wherein internal barriers that tend to hound increasing bureaucracies tend not to apply to Stripe.

Building and maintaining this kind of culture isn't magic, of course, and can't simply be wished for.  But like the theory itself describes, the first step to solving a problem involves knowing that it can be solved, and that one will have to go looking for the solution.  This also implies things about how each of us should individually approach our own problems, and how we should see the relationship between ourselves and others with their own problems.  It implies a "growth" or "positive-sum" mindset.  It implies that creativity and persistence are more than nice to have, but actually a *systematic advantage* in any circumstance.

Knowing these things doesn't change a person overnight, and it doesn't guarantee any particular success.  New problems are inevitable, after all.  But, knowing is most of the battle, and it is often useful to be able to short-circuit pessimism, self-doubt, and fatalistic attitudes when they start draining energy.  When a person is able to capture the most possible energy and attention to attack their goals, regardless of whatever other intrinsic talents they have, they might end up looking "oddly effective at most things."
