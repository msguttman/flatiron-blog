[OpenAI](https://openai.com/) recently released their most recent "Generative Pretrained Transformer", known commonly as GPT-3.  If its predecessor (GPT-**2**) was already a *surprising* advance in what we could expect from the trajectory of AI, the power of GPT-3 was met with something more like Shock and Awe.

I used an early production application to ask GPT-3 about itself.

I am only beginning to grasp the possibilities of this kind of system, but more entrepreneurial people have already set to work using it to improve software developement.

Here's Amjad Massad, the creator of Repl.it making a tool to quickly describe the function of code in natural language.

And from the opposite tac, here's an application to take a natural language descripion of desired code, and let GPT-3 produce the output.

Sharif has constructed similar tools to create code snippets accross language domains.

GPT-3 was not specifically trained in any way to recognize, much less manipulate or create, code of any kind.  It was created with unsupervised detection of language features across the internet, and some of that just happened to include enough code to make it as functional as your average notice programmer.

While GPT-3 might not be replacing software developers next week, it's worth reflecting that 10 years ago machine learning algorithms could create from scratch replicas of human faces that looked about like what an decent artist could produce with pencil and paper.  Now they can construct novel human faces so compelling that it takes special knowledge to even know how to look for the signs of a particular image being fabricated.

Like all technological improvement, this is going to produce some growing pains, but it should ultimately let humans focus on more creative, more interesting tasks.  The role of a software developer will just keep moving up layers of abstraction.  Someone will need to understand at a higher level how different pieces of code are supposed to work together, and how they relate to the broader function of a particular software.

We won't be in real trouble until GPT-10 starts deciding that it knows better than we do what we should be doing on the internet.
