I am a professional analyst and software engineer in Chicago, Illinois.

I think and write about Philosophy of Science, Epistemology, Consciousness, and Ethics, as well as related topics in technology, economics, politics and culture.

I hold degrees in philosophy and business from the University of Iowa, and in literature and education from Northern Illinois University.
